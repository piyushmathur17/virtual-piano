# About
I've forked this project from www.github.com/otanim/virtual-piano and added the autocomplete functionality. The deep learning model can be found in the predictor model file and uses keras lstm network with tensorflow backend and was trained on the music sequences in js/db/music_list. This was my first time working with javascript.
